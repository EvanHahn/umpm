umpm, a package manager for CAEN Linux students
===============================================

A simple-to-understand package manager that doesn't require root. Made for University of Michigan CAEN students but might work elsewhere.

Installation:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvanHahn/umpm/master/install | bash
```

Usage:

```sh
umpm install node
```

Still very much a work in progress.

Installing the dev version
--------------------------

While this is being developed, it might make sense to install the development version.

    # clone this repo
    # cd into it
    ./install --dev

Then use as normal.
