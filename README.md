umpm, a package manager for CAEN Linux students
===============================================

The goal is to make something like apt-get or [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for University of Michigan CAEN students.

Installation:

```bash
python2 -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.github.com/EvanHahn/umpm/master/install)"
```

Usage:

```bash
umpm install node
```

Still very much a work in progress.
