This also installed npm and nvm. If you want to install other versions
of Node (like 0.11), check out the nvm documentation.

You're almost done! Run and add the following to your bashrc/zshrc:

  source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

If you don't know what that means, run these two commands:

  source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
  echo "source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
